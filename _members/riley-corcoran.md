Riley Corcoran, M.S. (she/her) is an information sciences professional working under Dr. Joanne Cole in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi). Riley completed her Master's in Biology at the University of Denver, where she searched for signatures of selection in populations of previously migratory fish that were landlocked by colonial dams. Her work now will explore the heritability of dietary traits, testing the association between heritability and phenotype processing. Outside of work, she enjoys any fiber arts craft and reading across the spectrum of sci-fi and fantasy - even better if she gets to craft and read by listening to a good audiobook.
