# Welcome to the Cole Lab 

We are a computational group at the [University of Colorado School of Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/) using large-scale human genomics as a tool to learn more about diet's role in the body and in human health, with a focus on cardiometabolic disease.

# Highlights

How do our genes influence our dietary intake? What are the underlying environmental and biological mechanisms? Which aspects of dietary intake causally influence disease? How can we extract more or new information from dietary assessments? Can genetics play a role in Precision Nutrition?
